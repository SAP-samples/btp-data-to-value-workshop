# SAP BTP Data-to-Value Bootcamp
This SAP BTP Data-to-Value Bootcamp is developed and delivered by Partner Ecosystem Success Organization (formerly known as GPO) of SAP SE, which aims to help SAP partners quickly jump started with SAP BTP for Data-to-Value journey. The bootcamp uses an end-to-end storyline about a bookshop, helping the bookshop manager to turn  data into business values with the SAP BTP solution portfolio of Database, Data Management & Analytics. 
<br/>
<br/>
The bootcamp series events are organized and delivered through SAP Virtual Event Services with a format of presentation, demo and exercise, which lasts 3~4 hours each day and 3 days in total. In addition, the system access of this bootcamp are prepared for the participants by SAP organizer. However, the system requirement and data preparation is also documented in this repository for those who don't attend the bootcamp, where you can build up your own system landscape to complete this bootcamp on your own with self-pace learning.
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the bootcamp, a badge will be issued by SAP to those participants who have gone throughout the whole bootcamp  and completed all the exercise tasks as a recognition of achievement.
<br/>
<br/>
The bookshop solution is a popular [example](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-cap-samples/tree/master/bookshop) of SAP Cloud Application Programing Model (CAP) about side-by-side extensibility with SAP BTP, also as an exercise of our SAP BTP Extension Suite Bootcamp.

<br/>
John, the owner of an online bookshop of children literature named Amilka Bookshop Ltd. base in London, as a fan of Roald Dahl since childhood back in the 80's who has a dream of owning a bookshop in neighborhood with heaps of attractive collections of children reading, has started his own online bookshop business(eCommerce) since 2011 specializing in children literature, and used a local ERP for operation. As the business grows and expands geographically, in late 2020, John has hired an SAP partner to replace the local ERP with a modern modular cloud ERP **SAP S/4HANA Cloud**, and migrate the legacy bookshop management solution to SAP HANA Cloud with SAP Cloud Application Programing Model, which has seamless integration with SAP S/4HANA Cloud. The historical book sales data from 2011 to 2020 are extracted from legacy ERP into csv files. The project has successfully gone live since beginning of 2021. Since then the book sales have been maintained in SAP S/4HANA Cloud, the book catalog and online orders are managed with the new bookshop solution.  <br/>

Now the data landscape of Amilka Bookshop Ltd. as:
- bookshop solution (books, authors, genres, etc.) in SAP HANA Cloud
- current book sales data since 2021 in SAP S/4HANA Cloud
- archived historic book sales data from 2011 to 2020 in AWS S3

As an SAP partner, through this bootcamp youâ€™ll help John with the Data-to-Value journey to address business questions such as:
- sales KPI of current quarter
- quarterly books sales trend since 2020
- top best-selling books of 2021, and drill down by month, author and book.
- book sales forecast and planning
- book recommendation with machine learning to improve the customer purchasing experience and upsales.
- book genre clustering with machine learning to automate the book genre prediction for new books. 
- ...

### Solution Architecture
