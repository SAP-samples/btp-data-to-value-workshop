### Storyline
![Bookshop Data-to-Value Storyline](resources/bookshop-d2v-storyline.png)
John, the owner of an online bookshop business named Amilka Bookshop Ltd based in London, as a fan of Roald Dahl since childhood in 80s who has a dream of owning the bookshop in his nabourhood with heaps of attrative children literature collections, has started his own bookshop busines since 2011 as an online bookshop web shop specialising on children literature.
